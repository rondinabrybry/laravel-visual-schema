## 📋 Project Summary

We have successfully implemented comprehensive **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) design capabilities** for your Laravel Visual Schema Designer package. The package now provides professional database design tools with interactive relationship drawing and intelligent foreign key detection.

---

## ✅ ERD Features Implemented

### 🔗 Interactive Relationship Drawing
- **Point-and-click drawing**: Click source table → click target table to create relationships
- **Visual feedback**: Live mouse tracking while drawing relationships  
- **Drawing mode toggle**: Switch between normal editing and relationship drawing modes
- **Smart drawing assistance**: Visual indicators and clear instructions

### 🧠 Foreign Key Auto-Detection
- **Convention-based detection**: Automatically finds `user_id` → `users.id` patterns
- **Smart algorithms**: Detects relationships from column naming conventions  
- **Bulk relationship creation**: Apply all detected relationships with one click
- **Visual indicators**: Shows detected vs. manually created relationships

### 🎨 Professional Crow's Foot Notation
- **One-to-One relationships**: `||—||` notation with proper visual symbols
- **One-to-Many relationships**: `||—<` notation with crow's foot endings
- **Many-to-Many relationships**: `<—>` notation with crow's feet on both sides
- **Clean visual lines**: Professional ERD appearance matching industry standards

### 🛠️ Comprehensive Relationship Management
- **Dedicated ERD toolbox**: Professional tools section with relationship controls
- **Relationship sidebar**: Complete list of all relationships with full details
- **Edit capabilities**: Change relationship types after creation (1:1, 1:M, M:M)
- **Individual deletion**: Remove specific relationships with confirmation
- **Export integration**: Relationships included in all export formats (PNG, PDF, SVG)
